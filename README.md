## What is Firefly Catcher?

I was inspired to make a game where the player can listen to relaxing nightime sounds while collecting fireflies. This is mobile-freindly and simple to play. Easy mode generates 10 fireflies, medium 20 and hard 30. Once game begins, there is a looping sound of crickets.
