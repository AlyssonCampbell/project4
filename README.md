planning for project 4
I want to make a game that the player uses wsad controls to move a character around the screen
there will be objects to be caught that will bounce around the screen, when one is caught, the score will increase
flavor it like catching fireflies? the color shifts from light to blending in with the background
maybe a ghost catcher??
ghosts appear at random locations and you move a flashlight to find them?
mvp:
start game button
ability to move a game piece around using the wsad keys
something hides the items that need to be collected
the score tracks how many have been gathered

silver:
timer option for catching as many items in a certian time
cool look
jar fills up with the caught items?

gold:

//pseudocoding for project
need score tracker
make an object (div?) that can be moved around the screen with the keys
have other objects randomly generate and bounce around the screen until they collide with the movable object
when the two objects collide then increase the score
have a number target option and an option for catch as many in a certian time
